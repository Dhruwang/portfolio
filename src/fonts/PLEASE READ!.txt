You may redistribute this font, but please include everything contained within the .zip folder the font was downloaded in.

For any queries, just email nal@nalgames.com with what you want to ask, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. If you can, please include the name of the font as well as the word "font" in the email title so I can prioritise a reply to it. Cheers.
